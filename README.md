# Assignment 2 - 210408043

## File Organization
- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing six box elements (A–F).
- `styleA.css`: Styles for Version A — vertically stacked boxes with equal spacing.
- `styleB.css`: Styles for Version B — five boxes in top-left, one fixed in bottom-right.

## Challenges Faced
- Ensuring vertical spacing in Version A adjusted dynamically with window resizing.
- Positioning the final box (F) in Version B to stay fixed in the bottom-right corner regardless of screen size.
- Implementing hover effects and dotted borders while maintaining layout consistency.
- Avoiding use of JavaScript or external libraries as per assignment constraints.

## Notes
- To switch between versions, change the stylesheet link in `index.html`.
- GitHub repository includes all files. For private access, `alidaghighi` has been added as collaborator.
